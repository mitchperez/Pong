## Installation
Use the package manager [conda](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install turtle. The TurtleGraphics package allows to create either simple or sophisticated graphics on the basis of lines. The Turtle, described by its location and orientation, is moved by issuing plotting commands that are relative to its own position. 

```bash
conda install -c r r-turtlegraphics
```
